# IMPs (Litepaper v1)
Abstract
Poor social health, poverty, lack of social programs and overall coordination lie at the roots of our inability to healthily progress as a species. Giving citizens more political power and insights on the inner mechanics of their social systems is now more possible than ever.
In our pursuit of enhancing community engagement we must carefully consider the operating systems and models underpinning our communities and organizations. 
These systems, which have evolved over thousands of years, remain central to our collective existence yet the opaque and arcane nature of many of these systems often undermines trust and inhibits meaningful community interaction. 
This opacity and lack of coordination can discourage engagement, and make it difficult and inefficient to operate. With today’s technology we have the power to mitigate many of the social issues described above, even litigatory behavior amongst HOAs and Homeowners, Non-profits, and more. To generate more trust, participation, and symbiosis within our underlying social infrastructures,we must focus on the development of our political infrastructures, underlying governance models, and approaches on bridging the two. 

# Problem Statement
Non-profit organizations in the United States control over $2 trillion in assets, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics.
The American tax system collects over $3.5 trillion each year, according to the IRS.
Despite being one of the world's oldest democracies, the United States often sees less than 60% of its eligible voters participate in presidential elections, according to the United States Elections Project.
Nearly 40 million Americans live in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,
70% of Americans feel frustrated with the current system, while more than half don't trust their government to do what's right. We're not talking about just a small group of disgruntled citizens. We're talking about millions feeling disempowered, marginalized, and unheard, and that is just in America alone.
Our primary motivation is to tackle existing gaps in incentive models for public goods funding. Traditional mechanisms lack transparency and accountability, leading to not just inefficiencies in fund allocation and utilization but weakens relationships among funders, donors, and grantees.
By shaping the way we hold grantees accountable, we can enhance coherence between individuals and their local communities through public goods funding, enhancing individuals’ feelings of ownership, community, and voice. We hope these factors can greatly increase individuals' sense of purpose within their communities, and the efficiency in capital allocation for communities.

#  Problem Statement Continued

Corruption and Fraud in Political Structures
Structures, such as city councils and municipal governments, are responsible for managing public funds and ensuring that they are used effectively for the benefit of the community. However, corruption and fraud can undermine the efficient use of these resources, leading to:
Misallocation of funds, with public money being diverted for personal gain or used to favor specific groups or interests.
Difficulty in detecting and prosecuting cases of fraud and corruption, as traditional financial systems may lack the necessary transparency and traceability.
Erosion of public trust in local political structures, resulting in reduced civic engagement and a weakened sense of community.
Inefficient and Opaque Financial Management in HOAs
HOAs are responsible for managing the financial resources collected from homeowners to maintain and improve their communities. However, the current financial management practices within many HOAs suffer from inefficiencies and a lack of transparency, leading to:
Inadequate financial oversight, resulting in the mismanagement or misappropriation of funds.
Difficulty in tracking and auditing the use of funds, which can lead to disputes among homeowners and mistrust in the HOA board.
Inefficient collection of dues and fees, with delays or errors in processing payments and an inability to effectively enforce compliance.

Solutions

Combining and expanding modern grant stacks to incorporate proposal-based spending as grantees allows donors to have more power in holding their grantees accountable, with the potential to withdraw or recycle trapped funds from negligent projects.
Require a fee to upload a grant to the general application itself. Grantees should declare a minimum time period they can set for ending voting periods from donors to vote on fund pulls as well as a threshold needed to pull funds for enhanced accountability mechanisms, or vice versa, a threshold to put the request on pause, this threshold can be met with either weighted or cumulative votes.. These delays can be triggered at multiple points and extended as higher thresholds are met until the proposal is declined, giving other donors more time to vote and allowing it to meet a state of failure. Optimally, a UI dashboard would be used to display or view proposals awaiting action. 
 Alternatively we can implement alternative accountability mechanisms to pressure sectors to focus on the needs of their community by cutting off streamlined or batch based quadratic funding if thresholds of satisfaction from funders or donors are not met. Understanding what systems will best fit your communities needs is going to be crucial in the development of foundational governance structures for local, digital, and global communities.
With these tools we can provide alternative funding solutions to struggling nonprofits, and structurally failing organizations thanks to the power of blockchain.



# Architecture

By integrating technologies like ERC6506, ERC1155 Impact certificates, Ethereum Attestation Services, custom Allo v2 strategies within a dynamic UI Our project aims to provide immutable yet dynamic on-chain reports and assessments on how funds are being utilized, with integrated accountability mechanisms.
Reports are dynamic in the sense that they can be expanded upon, graded, measured, and scored over time by the donors or participants of that project or ecosystem. These measurements can be adjusted by the deployers of the contracts to fit their communities needs, with little to no code experience required.

# Implementation

By optimizing initially for individual use cases, we can provide a platform for humanitarian relief on an individual basis, allowing individuals to better understand the processes larger entities could take on in being more transparent and accountable with their funding.
After successfully testing our genesis governance models, we will begin working with and implementing the mechanisms into local charities, non-profits, and eventually HOAs.


Operating Systems & DAOs
Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, have seen immense growth in the past couple years. In this sector as people experiment with building companies on top of tokens and smart contracts in decentralized manners, but as new organization types bloom, so does the need for infrastructure.
Some current estimates put the value governed by DAO [treasuries at over $6 billion just in the year of 2021 alone, and the number is certainly growing.
In the dynamic universe of Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), an atmosphere of continuous evolution, learning, and experimentation prevails. The promise of self-managing entities that can redefine work experiences across the globe is particularly inspiring. However, the lack of universally accepted best practices indicates that the field is still in its infancy. This prompts us to consider the analogy of a DAO to an operating system.
Similar to a computer’s operating system there remains a sort of “black box” or layer of abstraction. whereas the logic sequences, and inner components are very much hidden from the modern day user, a DAO operating system could be conceived as the unseen layer of beliefs, principles, and norms that direct a DAO's functionality. Many of the underlying assumptions we have on human behaviors mold our experience, cultivation and interaction with DAOs.
This analogy can provide useful insights into the usually obscured realm of organizational culture. It provides us with a set of conceptual tools that help identify areas where deliberate choices can influence the organization's modus operandi.


# Roadmap

The Impact Measurement Protocols (IMPs) represent a pioneering venture within a broader spectrum of projects, movements, and initiatives spearheaded by Ninit. Since its inception in 2018, Ninit has been composed of a dedicated team of experts with a deep commitment to exploring, analyzing, and innovating within the realms of governance and economic sustainability. IMPs stand at the forefront of this ambitious journey, embodying our first significant step towards actualizing a vision for more transparent, accountable, and effective governance systems. This project is not just an isolated endeavor but a foundational piece in a much larger puzzle. We aim to set new standards in how governance and economic systems can be designed to be more inclusive, equitable, and capable of addressing the complex challenges of our time.
Looking ahead, Ninit envisions a series of interconnected projects that build upon the groundwork laid by IMPs. Each subsequent initiative will delve deeper into specific aspects of governance and economics, from enhancing community engagement and participation to fostering economic models that prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains. Our ultimate goal is to create a cohesive ecosystem of solutions that can work in harmony to transform the landscape of governance and economics, making them more adaptable, resilient, and aligned with the principles of regeneration and inclusivity.



# Conclusion

In harnessing the power of advanced data collection methodologies and in-depth analysis, we have unearthed pivotal insights that herald the dawn of a new paradigm in governance—one that is more equitable, inclusive, and attuned to the nuanced needs of our society. Our research serves as a cornerstone for the evolution of governance into an era marked by empathy and digital inclusivity, where technology is not just a tool but a bridge to understanding and meeting the diverse needs of communities across the globe.
This endeavor underscores the critical importance of agility and continuous evolution within our social infrastructures, advocating for systems that are not only responsive but also resilient in the face of the relentless pace of societal and technological change. It is a clarion call to recenter the aspirations and voices of individuals within the technological narrative, empowering them to shape their communities in profoundly impactful ways.
By providing the scaffolding for future communities and organizations, we are not just envisioning new frameworks of operation but are actively laying the foundation for a world where community engagement and purpose are not mere ideals but lived realities. This vision empowers individuals to contribute meaningfully to their communities, ensuring that every voice is heard and every contribution valued.
In essence, our work is a testament to the transformative potential of technology when wielded with intention and insight. It is a step towards reimagining governance as a collaborative, inclusive process that elevates the collective intelligence and spirit of our communities.
